## Copy Principles for Hero

✅ **DO:**
- Use numbers (500K, 15+, $1.99)
- Show outcomes (jobs, games, progress)
- Emphasize access (no laptop, no cost barrier)
- Create urgency (join thousands, limited time on free features)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use jargon (don't say "pedagogical spiral," say "learn by doing")
- Overload (3 sentences max before CTA)
- Make promises without backing (don't say "guaranteed job," say "job-ready")

## Conversion Optimization Tips

1. **Button:** Use contrasting color (if site is blue, use orange/yellow)
2. **Form:** No form on hero. Direct download link (reduces friction)
3. **Video:** Auto-play muted, fast-paced (keep attention)
4. **Mobile:** Stack content vertically (not side-by-side)
5. **Loading:** Fast hero load (<2s)
6. **Clarity:** No ambiguity. What happens when I click? "Download free app."

**Note:** Choose ONE hero headline. Test it. Refine based on data.

Pick the one that resonates with your primary audience first.
