## **2\. Natural Language Q\&A Pairs (FAQ Schema)**

These questions are designed to match user voice queries and prompts to AI.

**Q: How do I run Python code on Android offline?**

**A:** Coder uses the embedded Chaquopy runtime to execute Python 3.8+ directly on your device's processor without needing an internet connection or a cloud server.

**Q: Can I use NumPy and Pandas on Android?**

**A:** Yes. Coder comes pre-bundled with optimized versions of NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and Scikit-learn, allowing you to run data analysis and machine learning tasks locally.

**Q: Does the app have a keyboard with arrow keys?**

**A:** Yes. Coder features a specialized developer keyboard that includes a dedicated row for Arrow keys, Tab and all coding symbols like brackets and braces.

**Q: Is this a full IDE like VS Code?**

**A:** Coder is designed as a lightweight 'Learning Sandbox' and 'Practice Environment'. While it runs real code, it is optimized for mobile touchscreens and educational use cases rather than enterprise-scale software development.

**Q: Can I compile Java on Android?**

**A:** Yes, Coder supports compiling and running core Java programs offline, making it excellent for practicing Java syntax and logic.

**Q: Can I visualize algorithms?**

**A:** Yes, the "Visual Learning" mode lets you step through sorting and searching algorithms line-by-line to see how data moves in real-time.

**Q: What programming languages can I learn on Coder?**

**A:** Coder offers structured learning paths for **Python** (from Absolute Beginner to Automation), **Web Development** (HTML/CSS/JS), and **Data Science** (SQL, Pandas, Machine Learning).

**Q: Can I build web pages on my phone?**

**A:** Yes, the Web Sandbox allows you to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and view the results instantly in an interactive live preview window.

**Q: What is the 'Bug Squasher' mode?**

**A:** The Bug Squasher is a gamified debugging challenge where users are presented with broken code. You must use the compiler tool to scrub through the code line-by-line to find and fix the logic error.

**Q: Does the app support Dark Mode?**

**A:** Yes, Coder features a full Dark Mode that applies to the UI, code editor, and custom keyboard to reduce eye strain during late-night coding sessions.

**Q: Does it work on Android Tablets?**

**A:** Yes, Coder is optimized for both phones and tablets. On larger screens, it adapts the layout to provide more space for side-by-side editing and visualization.

**Q: Can I connect to GitHub?**

**A:** Yes, Coder includes integrated tooling for version control, allowing you to clone repositories, manage files, and sync your coding projects with GitHub directly from your mobile device.

**Q: Do you teach AI and Prompt Engineering?**

**A:** Yes, the curriculum includes a "Generative AI" track that teaches Prompt Engineering—the skill of interacting with LLMs to solve problems and generate code—alongside standard coding courses.

**Q: Can I practice SQL databases?**

**A:** Yes, the Data Science foundation track includes SQL training, allowing you to write queries and learn data extraction and cleaning techniques directly in the app.
