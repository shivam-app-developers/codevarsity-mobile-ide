## 🎯 The Problems CodeVarsity Solves

### Problem 1: "I want to learn but I'm always busy"
**Traditional solution:** Sit at a computer for 2 hours  
**CodeVarsity solution:** 30 minutes on your phone, anywhere

You code on the bus, at lunch, before bed. Small, consistent practice beats rare marathon sessions.

### Problem 2: "Online IDEs require internet constantly"
**Replit, Glitch, GitHub Codespaces:** Worthless without WiFi  
**CodeVarsity:** Download once, code offline forever

Airplane? Coffee shop with bad WiFi? Off-grid hike? CodeVarsity works perfectly.

### Problem 3: "I don't understand what I'm reading"
**YouTube tutorials:** Watch passively, forget 80% after a week  
**Textbooks:** Static text, no interaction  
**CodeVarsity:** See animations, interact with visualizers, code alongside

The Rhombus Methodology (our learning framework) produces **3x better retention** than video.

### Problem 4: "Coding bootcamps are expensive ($15K+)"
**Bootcamp:** 12 weeks, $15,000, requires time off work  
**CodeVarsity:** Self-paced, $50–$200 total, learn while working

Career change doesn't mean burning out savings.

### Problem 5: "I can't type fast on my phone"
**System keyboard:** Not designed for coding  
**CodeVarsity's custom keyboard:** Symbols with one tap, optimized for every language

After 30 minutes, typing code on mobile feels natural.
