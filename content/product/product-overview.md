## 💡 Why CodeVarsity?

### Problem We Solve

**Existing Options Are Limited:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Online IDEs** (Replit, Glitch) | Work anywhere | Requires internet always |
| **Physical Laptop** | Best experience | Heavy, expensive, not always available |
| **YouTube Videos** | Free content | Passive, hard to practice |
| **Textbooks** | Structured | No interactivity, static |

**CodeVarsity Fills the Gap:**
- ✅ Full IDE + learning, offline
- ✅ Hands-on, interactive (not passive)
- ✅ Fits in your pocket
- ✅ Affordable ($1.99–$4.99/month)

### Our Unique Approach

**The Rhombus Methodology™**

We invented a 7-layer learning framework that takes you from zero knowledge to expert mastery:

```
1. Overview (big picture)
2. Theory (why it works)
3. Examples (how you use it)
    ↓
4. MASTERY DEEP DIVE (master every aspect)
    ↓
5. Real Problems (solve challenges)
6. Synthesis (connect concepts)
7. Mastery Check (prove you understand)
```

**Result:** Retention rates **3x higher** than video tutorials. Users graduate from our courses as true practitioners, not just consumers of content.
