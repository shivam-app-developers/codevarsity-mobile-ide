# True Offline Coding on Android

Most "mobile IDEs" are actually just text editors that send your code to a remote server for compilation. This means:
1. You need a constant internet connection.
2. Compilation is slow due to network latency.
3. You can't code on a plane, subway, or in remote areas.

## The CoderKit Difference

CoderKit takes a harder path: we embed real, industrial-strength compilers and runtimes directly into the Android application.

### Python: Chaquopy
For Python, we utilize Chaquopy, a powerful plugin that allows Python to run seamlessly on Android. This isn't a stripped-down version; it supports standard libraries and even many C-extension modules like NumPy.

### Java: ECJ (Eclipse Compiler for Java)
We embed the Eclipse Compiler for Java (ECJ). This allows you to compile Java source code into bytecode (.class files) and execute them on the Android Runtime (ART) or a custom classloader, right on your device.

### C: TCC (Tiny C Compiler)
For C programming, we use TCC. It's incredibly small and fast, making it perfect for mobile devices. It compiles C code to native machine code in memory, allowing for instant execution.

## Why It Matters

**Speed:** Local compilation is instant. No waiting for server round-trips.
**Reliability:** Code anywhere. Your learning isn't tethered to Wi-Fi.
**Privacy:** Your code stays on your device. It's not sent to our servers unless you choose to back it up.

CoderKit turns your smartphone into a true development machine, empowering you to learn and build whenever inspiration strikes.
