    // General
    {
        category: "General",
        question: "What is CodeVarsity?",
        answer: "CodeVarsity is a mobile IDE and learning platform that lets you write, compile, and run real code offline on your Android device. It includes 40+ structured courses, 20+ interactive visualizers, and supports Python, Java, Go, C, and web development."
    },
    {
        category: "General",
        question: "Is CodeVarsity free?",
        answer: "Yes! CodeVarsity is free to download with a generous free tier including the sandbox IDE and introductory lessons. Premium courses and advanced features are available via one-time purchases or subscription."
    },
    {
        category: "General",
        question: "Is there an iOS version?",
        answer: "CodeVarsity is currently available on Android only. iOS support is planned for the future. Join our newsletter to be notified when it launches."
    },
    // Offline & Technical
    {
        category: "Offline & Technical",
        question: "How does offline execution work?",
        answer: "CodeVarsity embeds real language runtimes directly in the app: Chaquopy for Python 3.10, ECJ for Java, Yaegi for Go, and TCC for C. Everything runs locally on your device - no internet required."
    },
    {
        category: "Offline & Technical",
        question: "Can I use NumPy, Pandas, Flask, Django?",
        answer: "Yes! Python comes pre-bundled with NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Flask, Django, Requests, BeautifulSoup, and 20+ other libraries. All work offline."
    },
    {
        category: "Offline & Technical",
        question: "Does it support interactive input?",
        answer: "Yes! You can use input() in Python, Scanner in Java, and fmt.Scanln() in Go. Build interactive CLI programs just like on a desktop."
    },
    {
        category: "Offline & Technical",
        question: "Can I build web pages on my phone?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with live preview. You can even use React and Vue.js with in-browser Babel compilation."
    },
    // Learning
    {
        category: "Learning",
        question: "What is Ghost Code practice?",
        answer: "Ghost Code shows faded target code that you type along character-by-character. It builds muscle memory and helps you internalize syntax faster than just reading or watching."
    },
    {
        category: "Learning",
        question: "What are the interactive visualizers?",
        answer: "Visualizers are animated, interactive tools that show how code works. Examples include Memory Manager (stack/heap), Execution Trace (step-by-step), Algorithm Sandbox (sorting/searching), SQL Visualizer, and more."
    },
    {
        category: "Learning",
        question: "How are courses structured?",
        answer: "Courses follow a spiral methodology: start with high-level concepts, then progressively dive deeper. Each concept uses our Explain → Visualize → Test loop to ensure understanding before moving on."
    },
    // IDE Features
    {
        category: "IDE Features",
        question: "Does the keyboard have arrow keys?",
        answer: "Yes! Our custom developer keyboard includes arrow keys, Tab, Ctrl modifier, and quick access to coding symbols like brackets, semicolons, and operators."
    },
    {
        category: "IDE Features",
        question: "Can I work on multi-file projects?",
        answer: "Yes! The workspace supports folders, multiple files, and asset management. Great for building real projects with HTML/CSS/JS or Python packages."
    },
    {
        category: "IDE Features",
        question: "Is there code formatting and linting?",
        answer: "Yes! Real-time linting catches errors as you type. Auto-formatting follows language standards (PEP8 for Python, gofmt for Go, etc.)."
    },
    // Purchasing
    {
        category: "Purchasing",
        question: "How do I buy a course?",
        answer: "Visit the Pricing page, select a course or subscription, and complete checkout with Cashfree. Purchases sync across devices when you log in with the same account."
    },
    {
        category: "Purchasing",
        question: "What payment methods are accepted?",
        answer: "We accept Credit/Debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex), PayPal, UPI, and Netbanking. International payments in 140+ currencies are supported."
    },
    {
        category: "Purchasing",
        question: "Can I get a refund?",
        answer: "Yes, we offer a 7-day refund policy for courses. If you're not satisfied, contact support within 7 days of purchase for a full refund."
    },
    // Comparison
    {
        category: "Comparison",
        question: "How is CodeVarsity different from Pydroid?",
        answer: "Pydroid is a Python-only sandbox. CodeVarsity offers multiple languages (Python, Java, Go, C), structured courses, interactive visualizers, and Ghost Code practice - it's a complete learning platform."
    },
    {
        category: "Comparison",
        question: "Why not just use YouTube tutorials?",
        answer: "Watching doesn't equal learning. CodeVarsity makes you actively practice with Ghost Code, debug with Bug Squasher, and test your understanding with quizzes. Active learning beats passive watching."
