## Common Mistakes

### **Mistake 1: Chasing Highest Salary**
"I'll learn C++ because it pays most"

Reality: If you hate systems programming, you'll be miserable.

**Fix:** Choose based on interest + salary

### **Mistake 2: Learning Only One Language**
"I'll be a Python expert"

Reality: Employers want people who know 2-3 languages

**Fix:** After Python, add JavaScript or Java

### **Mistake 3: Not Learning the Tools**
"I know JavaScript, I'm ready"

Reality: You also need to know React, Git, REST APIs, databases

**Fix:** Learn full stack, not just language

### **Mistake 4: Waiting for "Ready"**
"I'll apply when I'm perfect"

Reality: You learn by doing, not by preparation

**Fix:** Apply after 4-6 months, even if not perfect

## The Investing Analogy

Learning to code is like investing.

- Initial investment: 3-6 months time
- Annual return: $100K-200K (and growing)
- Total return over career: $10M+

That's a 200-400x ROI.

No wonder it's worth the effort.
