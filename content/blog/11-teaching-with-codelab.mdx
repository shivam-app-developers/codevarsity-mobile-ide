**Posted:** January 2025 | **Reading time:** 9 minutes

You're a teacher. You want to teach programming. But:

- You don't have a computer lab
- Students have only phones
- You're not a developer yourself
- Curriculum time is limited
- Engagement is low

CodeVarsity solves every one of these problems.

This guide shows how to use CodeVarsity in your classroom.

## Why CodeVarsity for Teaching?

### **Problem 1: No Computer Lab**
Traditional approach: Requires 30 desktop computers + IT support

CodeVarsity: Students use phones they already have

### **Problem 2: High Cost**
Traditional: $1000s for hardware + $100s/month for licenses

CodeVarsity: $100/year for 30 students = $3.33/student/year

### **Problem 3: Engagement**
Traditional: Lecture format, few see immediate results

CodeVarsity: Interactive, build games week 1, leaderboards, challenges

### **Problem 4: Teacher Prerequisites**
You don't need to be a programmer. CodeVarsity handles curriculum + grading.

### **Problem 5: Differentiation**
Traditional: One-speed-fits-all teaching

CodeVarsity: Self-paced, advanced students move faster, struggling students get support

- Explanation write-up: 20%

**Student Achievement:**
- Day 5: Students have built something functional
- Motivation: Sky-high (they actually coded!)
- Engagement: Uses own phone (familiar device)

### **Week 2: Variables and Control Flow**

**Goal:** Understand how programs store and process data

**Class Activities:**
1. Watch visualizer: Variables change in real-time
2. Complete challenges (20 easy challenges)
3. Build quiz game project

**Teacher Role:**

- Make it playable and fun
- Document your code

**Class Activities:**
1. Monday: Brainstorm project ideas (small games, simulations)
2. Tuesday-Thursday: Development time
3. Friday: Showcase / peer feedback / celebration

**Teacher Role:**
- Guide project selection (help students choose appropriate scope)
- Monitor progress (dashboard shows who's coding vs. not)
- Facilitate peer feedback
- Document successes for portfolios

**Grading:**
- Code functionality: 40%

1. **Progress View**
   - Which students completed Python 101
   - Which are on challenges
   - Who's stuck/need help
   - Overall class progression

2. **Individual Student Profile**
   - All code they've written
   - Challenge attempts and solutions
   - Time spent coding
   - Difficulty areas

3. **Leaderboards**
   - Challenge completion speed
   - Accuracy (fewer bugs)
   - Engagement (most hours)
   - Can motivate friendly competition

4. **Analytics**
   - Class average completion
   - Concept understanding
   - Difficulty areas for whole class
   - Trends over time

## Teaching Strategies That Work

### **Strategy 1: The Visualizer Moment**

When a student doesn't understand an algorithm:

1. Pull up visualizer on projector
2. Run algorithm step-by-step
3. Ask: "What happens next?"
4. Student watches, predicts, compares

**Result:** Understanding clicks in 2-3 minutes instead of 20 minutes of explanation.

### **Strategy 2: The Challenge Progression**

Students get stuck on hard challenges?

- Easy challenges build confidence
- Medium challenges apply concepts
- Hard challenges stretch thinkers
- Always have an "on-ramp"

Use dashboard to see who's struggling. Assign easier challenges as scaffolding.

### **Strategy 3: Peer Teaching**

Students who finish early?

- "Can you help Sarah understand loops?"
- Explaining to peers deepens understanding
- Builds leadership

### **Strategy 4: The Portfolio**

Save best work for portfolios:
- Screenshot of game
- Code with comments
- Student reflection: "What did I learn?"

Students graduate with proof of skills.

### **Strategy 5: The Leaderboard Motivation**

Friendly competition:
- "Most challenges solved this week"
- "Best code quality"
- "Most improved"

Celebrates different strengths (not just fast).

## Accommodating Different Learning Needs

### **Advanced Students**
- Let them move ahead to harder challenges
- Assign: "Can you solve this in fewer lines?"
- Challenge: "Optimize for speed"
- Extend: "Build original game"

### **Struggling Students**
- Break challenges into smaller steps
- Pair with peer mentor
- Use visualizers frequently
- Celebrate small wins

### **Students with Attention Challenges**
- Shorter coding sessions (15 min)
- Frequent breaks
- Tangible goals ("Finish 3 challenges today")
- Immediate rewards

### **Non-English Speakers**
- CodeVarsity has multi-language support
- Code is language-agnostic
- Visual feedback helps regardless of language
- Pair with bilingual peer

## Overcoming Common Obstacles

### **Obstacle 1: "Students Just Game Instead of Code"**

**Reality:** Phone access is important. But CodeVarsity's interface is designed for coding, not distraction.

**Solution:**
- Monitor via dashboard (see screen time)
- Set expectations: "This is for learning, not games"
- Use phone time in structured way

### **Obstacle 2: "They'll All Copy Each Other"**

**Reality:** Copying is different from understanding. If code passes visualizer and challenges, understanding is real.

**Solution:**
- Have them explain their code
- Ask follow-up questions
- Visualizer reveals understanding gaps

### **Obstacle 3: "I'm Not a Programmer"**

**You don't need to be.** CodeVarsity provides:
- Curriculum (you just facilitate)
- Auto-grading (no coding knowledge needed)
- Visualizers (you guide, CodeVarsity explains)
- Dashboard (shows who needs help)

Your role: Facilitator, not expert.

### **Obstacle 4: "They'll Get Bored"**

**Reality:** Code you write is more engaging than code you read.**

**Solution:**
- Week 1: Build something
- Leaderboards
- Challenges (game-like progression)
- Portfolio (pride in work)

Keeps engagement high.
