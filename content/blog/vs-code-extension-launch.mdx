## Mobile to Desktop, Seamlessly

Coding on a phone is great for learning on the go, but eventually, you want the power of a full desktop environment. Today, we're bridging that gap.

## The CodeVarsity Extension

Our new VS Code extension allows you to:

1.  **Sync Progress**: Continue your mobile courses right inside VS Code.
2.  **Use Real Tools**: Practice in the same environment used by professional developers at Facebook and Microsoft.
3.  **Unified Stats**: Every line of code you write in VS Code counts towards your CodeVarsity profile and streaks.

## How to Install

Search for "CodeVarsity" in the VS Code Marketplace or visit our downloads page.
