## The Problem with Traditional Learning

Most coding apps just show you text and ask you to type it back. This "monkey-see, monkey-do" approach doesn't build true understanding. You might memorize syntax, but you won't know how to solve problems.

## Enter the Rhombus

CoderKit uses a proven 4-step methodology we call the **Rhombus Methodology**:

1.  **Learn (Theory)**: Short, bite-sized lessons that explain a concept clearly.
2.  **Visualize (Mental Model)**: We use interactive visualizers to show you exactly what the computer is doing with memory, variables, and loops.
3.  **Ghost (Muscle Memory)**: You type over "ghost code" to get the feel of the syntax without the pressure of a blank screen.
4.  **Build (Application)**: You are given a problem and a blank compiler. You must solve it yourself.

## Why Visualizers Matter

Our visualizers are the secret sauce. Seeing a loop execute step-by-step, watching an array fill up in memory, or seeing a pointer move across a data structure bridges the gap between abstract code and concrete reality.
