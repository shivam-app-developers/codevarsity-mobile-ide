## 📚 What is Learn Mode?

Learn Mode is **CodeVarsity's interactive learning platform** built on the **Rhombus Methodology**—a scientifically-proven 7-layer framework for taking you from zero knowledge to expert mastery.

Unlike passive videos or reading, every concept teaches through:
- **Clear explanations** (with visuals)
- **Interactive visualizers** (animated demonstrations)
- **Hands-on practice** (guided code exercises)

## 🔄 The Learning Flow (Rhombus Methodology)

CodeVarsity uses a **7-layer learning system** that spirals from overview → mastery → application:

```
         Layer 1: Big Picture
         (What is this?)
             ↓
         Layer 2: Theory
         (Why does it work?)
             ↓
         Layer 3: Examples
         (How do I use it?)
             ↓
    ════════════════════════ (Widest point)
    Layer 4: MASTERY DEEP DIVE
    (Master every aspect in detail)
    ════════════════════════
             ↓
         Layer 5: Real Problems
         (Solve complex challenges)
             ↓
         Layer 6: Synthesis
         (Connect to other concepts)
             ↓
         Layer 7: Mastery Check
         (Can you teach this?)
```

**What this means for you:**
1. You first see the **big picture** (not lost in details)
2. You **dive deep** and master each piece
3. You **apply knowledge** to solve real problems
4. You become **expert** in the topic

## 🎨 Interactive Visualizers

The **secret sauce** of CodeVarsity learning. Instead of imagining how things work, you **see them animated**.

### Types of Visualizers

#### 1. Data Structure Visualizers
**Linked Lists:**
```
[1] → [2] → [3] → [4] → NULL

Tap nodes to see:
- How values store in memory
- How pointers connect nodes
- How insertion/deletion works
- Animation shows step-by-step changes
```

**Binary Trees:**
```
        5
       / \
      3   7
     / \ / \
    2 4 6  8

Tap nodes to:
- Traverse tree (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- Search for values
- Insert & delete values
- Watch rebalancing
```

**Hash Tables:**
```
[0] [empty]
[1] → "Alice"
[2] → "Bob" → "Charlie" (collision!)
[3] [empty]

See:
- Hash function result
- Collision resolution
- Why collisions happen
```

#### 2. Algorithm Visualizers
**Sorting Algorithms:**
- See bubbles swap in Bubble Sort
- Watch merging in Merge Sort
- Observe pivot selection in Quick Sort
- Compare speed visually

**Pathfinding Algorithms:**
- Watch A* find shortest path through maze
- See Dijkstra explore in expanding waves
- Visualize cost vs. distance
- Click obstacles to change maze

**Searching:**
- Binary search narrows down range (red/green regions)
- Linear search steps through one by one
- See search space shrink

#### 3. Language Feature Visualizers
**Python Memory:**
- Variables shown as boxes with values
- See reference vs. copy behavior
- Understand mutable vs. immutable
- Watch function call stacks grow/shrink

**Java OOP:**
- Class inheritance tree
- Method override chain
- Polymorphism in action
- See abstract classes & interfaces

**JavaScript Async:**
- Event loop shown as queue
- Promises animate through states
- async/await visualized as pause points
- Callback hell vs. clean code

### How to Use Visualizers

**1. Play the Animation:**
```
[▶ Play] [⏸ Pause] [⏹ Stop]
  Speed: [━━●──] 1x (adjust slider)
```

**2. Interact with the Visualizer:**
- **Drag nodes** - Move elements around
- **Tap steps** - Jump to specific step
- **Input values** - Change parameters
- **Toggle options** - Show/hide memory addresses, etc.

**3. Learn from Animation:**
- Watch the pattern repeat
- Pause at confusing points
- Adjust speed to observe details
- Rewatch to cement understanding

**Example: Binary Search Visualizer**
```
STEP 1: Find midpoint
[▢▢▢▢▢●▢▢▢▢▢]
     ↑ midpoint
     
STEP 2: Compare with target
     midpoint = 50
     target = 30
     30 < 50 → search left half
     
STEP 3: Narrow search space
[▢▢▢▢▢]
    ↑ new midpoint
    
... continues until found
```

## ✏️ Guided Practice (Hands-On Coding)

### What is Guided Practice?

**Guided Practice** = Code editor + hints that teach you the pattern

**How it works:**
1. **Challenge displayed** - "Write a function that doubles a number"
2. **Ghost code shown** - Semi-transparent hint code appears
3. **You type alongside hint** - Match the pattern yourself
4. **Validation checks** - CodeVarsity verifies your solution
5. **Next challenge** - Move to next when complete

### Example Guided Practice

**Challenge:**
```
Write a function that checks if a number is even.
```

**You see:**
```python
# Ghost code (semi-transparent, just a hint):
def is_even(_____):
    return _____ % 2 == 0

# You type:
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

✅ Correct! You completed this challenge!
```

### Benefits of Guided Practice
- ✅ You **learn by doing** (not watching)
- ✅ Hints prevent frustration
- ✅ Pattern-based learning
- ✅ Muscle memory for typing
- ✅ Confidence before free-form coding

### Types of Guided Exercises

| Type | Example | Your Task |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Fill in blanks** | `def area(r): return _____` | Type formula |
| **Implement method** | `class List: def append(self, item):` | Type method body |
| **Debug code** | Buggy code provided | Fix the errors |
| **Refactor** | Verbose code | Rewrite cleanly |
