## Go is Here

We are thrilled to announce that **Go (Golang)** is now fully supported on CodeVarsity!

## Why Go?

Go is the language of the cloud. It's used by Google, Netflix, Uber, and Twitch to build high-performance backend systems. It combines the speed of C with the ease of Python.

## What's Included?

*   **Offline Go Compiler**: Build and run Go programs without internet.
*   **Go Fundamentals Course**: Learn syntax, structs, and interfaces.
*   **Concurrency Visualizer**: See how Goroutines and Channels work visually.

## Get Started
