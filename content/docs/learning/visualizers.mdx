# Interactive Visualizers

CoderKit uses over 20 different types of visualizers to help you understand how code works.

## Group 1: AI-Authored Visualizers

These are structured lessons that guide you through concepts.

-   **InteractiveTheoryReader**: Conversational lessons with embedded questions.
-   **VirtualWorkbenchView**: See how hardware executes instructions.
-   **OsMemoryManagerView**: Visualizes how the OS manages RAM and apps.
-   **NetworkJourneyView**: Follow a data packet across the internet.
-   **GuidedPractice**: Hands-on typing practice with "Ghost Code".

## Group 2: Smart Visualizers

These are dynamic tools that react to your input or run algorithms.

-   **Algorithm Sandbox**: Visualize sorting (Bubble, Merge, etc.) and searching algorithms.
-   **Memory Manager**: See the Stack and Heap in action.
-   **SQL Visualizer**: Visualize tables and JOIN operations.
-   **Graph Visualizer**: See nodes, edges, and graph traversals like BFS/DFS.
-   **Bug Squasher**: Find and fix bugs in a gamified environment.

## How to Use Visualizers

1.  **Read the Instructions:** Each visualizer starts with a brief explanation.
2.  **Interact:** Tap buttons, drag sliders, or step through the timeline.
3.  **Observe:** Watch how the state changes (variables, memory, graphics).
4.  **Practice:** Many visualizers are followed by a coding challenge to reinforce what you saw.
