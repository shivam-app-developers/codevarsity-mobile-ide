# Profile Stats Explained

Your CoderKit profile is more than just a badge collection. It is a verified record of your coding ability.

## Core Metrics

### XP (Experience Points)
XP is gained by:
*   Completing lessons (+100)
*   Solving challenges (+500)
*   Daily login (+50)

### Streak
The number of consecutive days you have written at least one line of code.

### Lines Typed
We measure actual keystrokes in the editor. Copy-pasting code does not count towards this metric.
