## Hello, CoderKit!

Let's write your first program on CoderKit. It's simple and takes just a few minutes.

### Step 1: Open the Editor

1. Launch CoderKit on your Android device
2. Tap the **+ New File** button
3. Select **Python** as your language
4. Name your file `hello.py`

### Step 2: Write Your Code

Type the following code into the editor:

```python
print("Hello, CoderKit!")
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Welcome, {name}!")
```

### Step 3: Run Your Program

1. Tap the **Run** button (play icon)
2. You should see `Hello, CoderKit!` in the terminal
3. Type your name when prompted
4. See your personalized welcome message

### What Just Happened?

- **Line 1**: Printed text to the screen
- **Line 2**: Asked for user input
- **Line 3**: Used an f-string to include your name in the output

### Next Steps

Now that you've written your first program, try these challenges:

- **Practice 1**: Ask for two numbers and print their sum
- **Practice 2**: Create a simple quiz with 3 questions
- **Practice 3**: Build a number guessing game

## Tips for Success

✅ **Read error messages** - They tell you what's wrong  
✅ **Indent your code** - Python cares about spacing  
✅ **Test frequently** - Run your code after small changes  
✅ **Don't copy-paste** - Type it out to build muscle memory

## Troubleshooting

**"SyntaxError" message?**
- Check your colons (`:`) at the end of lines
- Make sure you're indented correctly
- Look for missing quotes

**Program hangs?**
- Your program might be waiting for input
- Tap the **Stop** button to cancel
- Check your `input()` calls
