## 🎓 How CodeVarsity Works in Classrooms

### 1. Blended Learning (Hybrid)
**In-class:** 
- Use CodeVarsity visualizers to teach concepts interactively
- Project on screen, discuss algorithm behavior
- Students follow along on phones/tablets

**At-home:**
- Students continue courses on phones (self-paced)
- Homework: Complete concept challenges
- Teacher sees progress in dashboard

**Benefit:** Students learn at own pace, teacher saves time on grading.

### 2. Flip the Classroom
**At-home (before class):**
- Student watches visualizer, reads explanation
- Does guided practice
- Attempts challenge

**In-class (next day):**
- Discuss misconceptions
- Deep dive on hard concepts
- Solve harder problems together
- Help struggling students

**Benefit:** Class time focuses on hard concepts, not basics.

### 3. Self-Paced Learning Lab
**Setup:**
- Computer lab with phones/tablets (can use student phones)
- CodeVarsity on all devices
- Teacher circulates and helps

**Workflow:**
- Student starts Python 101
- Works at own pace (30–45 min sessions)
- Teacher dashboard shows who needs help
- Teacher intervenes with struggling students

**Benefit:** Truly differentiated instruction (gifted students advance faster).

## 🎮 Gamification for Student Motivation

### Why Gamification Works
Students learn more when learning is fun. CodeVarsity includes:

### Streaks (The "Show Up" Motivation)
- **Daily streak counter** (consecutive days coding)
- **Badge at 7 days** (🔥 Fire badge)
- **Leaderboard** (who has longest current streak)

**Psychology:** "I don't want to lose my 12-day streak!" Gets students to practice consistently.

### Achievements (The "Progress" Motivation)
- 🌟 **First 5 Concepts** - Beginner
- 💎 **Course Complete** - Master
- 👑 **Expert** - 3+ languages
- 🏆 **Bug Squasher** - Solve 50 challenges
- 🎖️ **Teaching** - Help 10 classmates

**Psychology:** Collecting badges feels rewarding.

### Leaderboards (The "Competition" Motivation)
- **Weekly challenges** (solve harder problems, earn points)
- **Class leaderboard** (see how you rank vs. classmates)
- **Global leaderboard** (optional—competitive programmers love this)

**Psychology:** Friendly competition drives engagement.

**WARNING:** Leaderboards optional (opt-out per school). Research shows competition can discourage lower-performing students. We default to class-only (not global).
