## ⌨️ The Custom Keyboard

CodeVarsity's keyboard is **designed for coders**, not texting:

### Keyboard Rows (Top to Bottom)

| Row | Contains | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| **Symbols** | `{ } ( ) [ ] : ; = + - * /` | Language-specific coding symbols |
| **Numbers** | `0 1 2 3 ... 9` | Digits |
| **QWERTY** | `A B C D ... Z` | Letters |
| **Utilities** | `SNIP TAB UNDO REDO SPACE ENTER BACK` | Special keys |

### Special Keys Explained

- **SNIP** - Open code snippet library (for copy-paste)
- **TAB** - Insert indentation (2 spaces)
- **UNDO/REDO** - Undo or redo your typing
- **SPACE** - Large spacebar (easy to tap)
- **ENTER** - New line
- **BACK** - Delete character

### Shift & Caps Lock

- **Single Tap** on SHIFT → Next letter is UPPERCASE
- **Long Press** SHIFT → Toggle CAPS LOCK (all uppercase)
- **Tap Again** → Turn off CAPS LOCK

## ▶️ Running Your First Code

### Step 1: Write Code

Type a simple program:

```python
# Python example
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

### Step 2: Tap Run

1. Find the **▶ Run** button (top-right)
2. Tap it
3. Watch the **Terminal** open at the bottom

### Step 3: Interact (if needed)

If your code calls `input()`, the terminal shows a **text field**:

1. Type your response
2. Tap **Submit** (or press ENTER)
3. See the output

### What If It Fails?

- **"Language not installed"** → Download the runtime (1st run only)
- **"Syntax error"** → Red line under the mistake; fix and try again
- **"Runtime error"** → Message in terminal tells you what went wrong

**Pro Tip:** Don't close the terminal—tap the X only when you're done debugging.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Language download keeps failing"

- Check your internet connection (WiFi > cellular)
- Try again later (servers might be busy)
- Use cellular + WiFi simultaneously if available

### "My code won't run—what's wrong?"

1. Check the **error message** in the terminal
2. Look for **red underlines** in the editor (syntax errors)
3. Make sure the **language is downloaded** (Settings → Languages)
4. Restart the app (close completely, reopen)

### "Keyboard is too small"

- **iPad users:** CodeVarsity is touch-optimized; keyboard will be larger on bigger screens
- **Phone users:** Landscape mode gives more keyboard space

### "App is slow/crashing"

- Free up RAM (close other apps)
- Clear cache (Settings → Storage → Clear Cache)
- Uninstall unused language runtimes
