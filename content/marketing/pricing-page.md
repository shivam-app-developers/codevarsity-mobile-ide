## Pricing Psychology

### **Why These Prices?**

**$1.99/month:**
- Entry point (below coffee ≈ $5)
- Easy decision for students
- Removes "free vs. paid" friction

**$4.99/month:**
- Jump incentivizes monthly → annual
- Covers interview prep value
- Still cheap vs. bootcamp

**$99.99/year:**
- Annual commitment (25% year-round learners)
- Best value (saves ~$70/year vs. monthly)
- Anchors perception (makes monthly look cheap)

**$5.99/course:**
- For those not wanting subscription

- Alternative option (not everyone likes subscriptions)

**$100/education:**
- Per-school, not per-student
- 30-student max makes sense (class-sized)
- Cost-effective for schools (vs. 30× $4.99)
